# THE THING FROM THE FUTURE (DIGITAL EDITION)
---
<br>

The Thing from the Future is an award winning imagination game that challenges players to describe objects from a range of alternative futures.  
Originally created by Situation Labs, this is an unauthorised digital recreation of the game’s Print-And-Play Edition.  
Enjoy playing! Do share your favourite ideas on social media using the #FutureThing hashtag.  

## How to Play
The object of the game is to come up with the most entertaining and thought-provoking descriptions of hypothetical objects from different near-, medium-, and long-term futures.  
This game is best played with a group of 2-6 players. Each round, click to turn each of the 4 cards to generate a creative prompt.   
Players then write a short description (and sketch, if they wish!) of an object that fits the constraints of the prompt.  
Once ready, read out and share your descriptions. You are now free to collaborate on fleshing out the most interesting ideas as a group.  

## Key Card
1. Ⓐ Arc outlines  the  type  of  future  world  that  the  “thing”  comes  from, and how far away it is from today. There are four types of Arc, each an umbrella for countless possible scenarios:
  - Growth: A future in which ‘progress’ has continued
  - Collapse: A future in which society as we know it has come apart
  - Discipline: A future in which order is deliberately coordinated or imposed
  - Transform: A future in which a profound historical evolution has occurred
2. Ⓣ Terrain is  the  thematic  context  or  location  where  this  object  could be found in that future.
3. Ⓞ Object is  the  focus  for  your  imagination:  a  specific  cultural  artifact that reveals something about how this future is different from today.
4. Ⓜ Mood suggests  how  it  might  feel  to  experience  this  thing  from  the future.

This was my first attempt ever at coding something.  
The interface was written in html and styled using CSS. The cards span the way they do using a flexbox.  
I used vanilla javascript to randomise the prompts.  
The methodology used is likely very inefficient, although I'm proud of the results nonetheless. 
I listed out the various options for the prompts as strings in a variable manually. Used a simple math.floor.random formula to pull a random prompt from each of them on every click. 

If you like the project, say hello to me. I'm keen to learn more about web development, and practice more fun speculative projects. :)
